# (Default) Locale Resolver Filter
locale.name = Locale Resolver Filter
locale.description = Request Level filter which extracts the primary locale \
 from the Request, which has been transferred from the client in the HTTP \
 Accept-Language header. If a LocaleResolver service has been registered, that \
 service is called instead of getting the HTTP header value for the locale.
locale.default.name = Default Locale
locale.default.description = The default locale to assume if none can be \
 resolved from a LocalResolver service or the HTTP Accept-Language header. This \
 value must be in the form acceptable to the =java.util.Locale= class.
 

provider.name = JCR ResourceBundle Provider
provider.description = ResourceBundleProvider service which loads the messages \
 from the repository. You may configure how the provider accesses the \
 repository if the user name field is left empty, the provider accesses the \
 repository anonymously. Otherwise the given user name and password are used \
 to access the repository. Failing to access the repository, effectively \
 disables the provider.

user.name = User Name
user.description = The name of the user to log in to the repository to get the \
 resources. If this field is empty, the provider accesses the repository as \
 the anonymous user.

password.name = Password
password.description = The password used to log in to the repository to get \
 the resources. This field is only used if the user name field is not empty.

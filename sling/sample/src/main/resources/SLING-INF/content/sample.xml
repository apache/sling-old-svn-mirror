    The samples are located under the nt:unstructured "sample" node
    
    Defining the node in this sample.xml file overwrites the default node
    type nt:folder which would have been used for the sample directory if
    this file would not be available. See the node /sample/page/jsp for
    example, which has no definition in any XML or JSON file and thus is
    created as an nt:folder node.

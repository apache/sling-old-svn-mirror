provider.name = Apache Sling JCR ResourceBundle Provider
provider.description = ResourceBundleProvider service which loads the messages \
 from the repository. If the user name field is left empty, the provider will \
 log into the repository as the administrative user. Otherwise the given user \
 name and password are used to access the repository. Failing to access the \
 repository, effectively disables the provider.

user.name = User Name
user.description = The name of the user to log in to the repository to get the \
 resources. If this field is empty, the provider accesses the repository as \
 the administrative user.

password.name = Password
password.description = The password used to log in to the repository to get \
 the resources. This field is only used if the user name field is not empty.

locale.default.name = Default Locale
locale.default.description = The default locale to assume if none can be \
 resolved otherwise. This value must be in the form acceptable to the \
 java.util.Locale class.

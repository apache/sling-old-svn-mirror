<workspaceFilter version="1.0">
    <!--
        Any node that will contain customer data needs to be excluded.

        In this case anything under confirmed and orders can be freely
        excluded.

        If there is a mix then all provided nodes must be included and
        all custom nodes excluded. So if there is a folder 'test' under
        orders which this app provides then it must be included beside the
        exclude of the rest.

        If unsure what to do then go to the Composum Package Manager
        (/bin/packages.html) and create a test package. To to the package
        filter list and add filter entries until all of the app provides
        nodes are included but none of the customer generatedd nodes.

# Request Loggger Filter
request.log.name = Apache Sling Request Logger
request.log.description = Configures the main loggers of the request logger, \
 namely the request log and the access log. Further loggers may be configured \

 content type. In terms of Request Logger Service formats, request entry is \
 logged with the format "%t [%R] -> %m %U%q %H" and request exit is logged \
 with the format "%{end}t [%R] <- %s %{Content-Type}o %Dms".
request.log.outputtype.name = Request Log Type
request.log.outputtype.description = Type of request log destination. Select \
 "Logger Name" to write the request log to an SLF4J logger, "File Name" to \
 write the request log to a file (relative paths resolved against sling.home).
request.log.enabled.name = Enable Request Log
request.log.enabled.description = Whether to enable Request logging or not.
access.log.output.name = Access Log Name
access.log.output.description = Name of the destination for the request log. \
 The access log writes an entry for each request as the request terminates \
 using the NCSA extended/combined log format. In terms of Request Logger \
 Service formats the access log is written with the format \
 "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"".
access.log.outputtype.name = Access Log Type
access.log.outputtype.description = Type of access log destination. Select \

# RequestLoggerService (factory)
request.log.service.name = Apache Sling Customizable Request Data Logger

 logger.
request.log.service.onentry.name = Request Entry
request.log.service.onentry.description = Check if the logger is called on \
 request entry. Otherwise leave unchecked and the logger will be called on \

request.log.service.output.description = Name of the destination for the log \
 output. Depending on the output type this is a file name (absolute or \
 relative), a SLF4J logger name or the name under which a RequestLog service \
 has been registered.
request.log.service.outputtype.name = Logger Type
request.log.service.outputtype.description = Type of log destination. Select \
 "Logger Name" to write the access log to an SLF4J logger, "File Name" to \
 write the access log to a file (relative paths resolved against sling.home) \
 or "RequestLog Service" to use a named OSGi service registered with the \
 service interface "org.apache.sling.RequestLog" and a service property \
 "requestlog.name" equal to the Logger Name setting.

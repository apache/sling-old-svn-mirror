log.name = Sling Logging Configuration
log.description = Global configuration setup for the Sling OSGi LogService \
 implementation
log.level.name = Log Level
log.level.description = Root Logger log level setting.
log.file.name = Log File
log.file.description = The name and path of the log file. If this is empty, \
 logging goes to standard output (the console). If this path is relative it \
 is resolved below ${sling.home}.
log.file.number.name = Number of Log Files
log.file.number.description = The number of log files to keep. When the size of \
 the log file reaches the configured maximum (see Maximum Log File Size), \
 the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This setting specifies \
 how many generations (incl. the active log file) should be kept. This is a \
 positive numeric value. The default value is 5. 
log.file.size.name=Maximum Log File Size
log.file.size.description The maximum size of the log file. If this size is \
 reached the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This size \
 may be specified with size indicators KB, MB and GB. The default is 10MB.
log.pattern.name = Message Pattern
log.pattern.description = Message Pattern for formatting the log messages. \
 This is a java.util.MessageFormat pattern supporting up to five arguments: \
 {0} The timestamp of type java.util.Date, {1} the log marker, {2} the name \
 of the current thread, {3} the name of the logger, {4} the debug level and \
 {5} the actual debug message. If the log call includes a Throwable, the \
 stacktrace is just appended to the message.
 
log.factory.writer.name = Sling Logging Writer Configuration
log.factory.writer.description = Configure a Logger Writer for Sling Logging
 
log.factory.config.name = Sling Logging Logger Configuration
log.factory.config.description = Configure Loggers with levels, pattern and \
 destination
log.loggers.name = Categories
log.loggers.description = The categories applicable for this logger \
 configuration. Each category applies for any child category unless configured \
 otherwise. E.g. a category of org.apache.sling applies to category \
 org.apache.sling.commons unless there is a different configuration for \
 org.apache.sling.commons.

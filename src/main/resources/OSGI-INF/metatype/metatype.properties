 Repository Class Loaders is configurable.

classpath.name = Class Path
classpath.description = The class path in the repository to use as the class \
 path for all created Repository Class Loaders. All Class Loaders are configured \
 with the same class path. This class path must include any destinations used \
 by Java compilers writing to the Repository such as the JSP Script Handler, \
 which by default writes to "/var/classes". If no class path is defined, the \
 "/var/classes" folder is used by default. See also "Append Sling ID below".

owner.name = Repository Session User
owner.description = Name of a user owning the Repository Class Loader sessions. \
 If this is empty a simple administrative session is used. Otherwise the \
 administrative session is used to impersonate as the given user.

appendId.description = If this flag is enabled, the Sling ID is appended to the path \
 to store/read class files from.

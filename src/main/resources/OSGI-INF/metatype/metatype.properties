servletresolver.name = Apache Sling Servlet/Script Resolver and Error Handler
servletresolver.description = The Sling Servlet and Script Resolver has \
 multiple tasks: One it is used as the ServletResolver to select the Servlet \
 or Script to call to handle the request. Second it acts as the \
 SlingScriptResolver and finally it manages error handling by implementing \
 the ErrorHandler interface using the same algorithm to select error handling \
 servlets and scripts as is used to resolve request processing servlets and \
 scripts.

servletresolver.servletRoot.name = Servlet Registration Root Path
servletresolver.servletRoot.description = The default root path assumed when \
 registering a Servlet whose Servlet registration properties define a relative \
 path. The default value is "/apps". This path should be part of the search \
 path configured in the Resource Resolver Factory otherwise a thus registered \
 servlet may not be found.

servletresolver.scriptUser.name = Script User
servletresolver.scriptUser.description = This optional property can specify \
 the repository user who is used to read the scripts. If none is specified \
 the admin user is used by default.

servletresolver.cacheSize.name = Cache Size
servletresolver.cacheSize.description = This property configures the size of the \
 cache used for script resolution. A value lower than 5 disables the cache.

servletresolver.paths.name = Execution Paths
servletresolver.paths.description = The paths to search for executable scripts. If no path is configured \
 this is treated like the default (/ = root) which allows to execute all scripts. By configuring some \
 paths the execution of scripts can be limited. If a configured value ends with a slash, the whole sub tree \
 is allowed. Without a slash an exact matching script is allowed.
 
servletresolver.defaultExtensions.name = Default Extensions
servletresolver.defaultExtensions.description = The list of extensions for which the default behavior \
 will be used. This means that the last path segment of the resource type can be used as the script name.

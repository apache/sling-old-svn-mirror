	    <h1>Welcome to the Sling Launchpad</h1>
	    
		<p>
			<a href="http://sling.apache.org">Apache Sling</a> is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository, 
			such as <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org">Apache Jackrabbit</a>, to store and manage content.

			Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on simple name conventions, 
			to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.

			The embedded Apache Felix OSGi framework and <a href="system/console">console</a> provide a dynamic 
			runtime environment, where code and content bundles can be loaded, unloaded and reconfigured at runtime.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	The Sling Launchpad is a ready-to-run Sling configuration, providing an embedded 
	    	JCR content repository and web server, a selection of Sling components, and 
	    	documentation and examples. The Launchpad makes it easy to get started with Sling 
	    	and to develop script-based applications.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>
			To get started with Sling, see our
			<a href="http://sling.apache.org">website</a> and
			the 
			<a href="http://sling.apache.org/site/discover-sling-in-15-minutes.html">
			Sling in 15 minutes
			</a>
			tutorial.
		</p>    	
		<p>
			Note that you can mount the repository via WebDAV to explore or modify content,
			simply use the <a href="./">root URL</a> as the WebDAV server URL.
		</p>
        <p>
           You are currently logged in as user <b id="username">????</b> to workspace <b id="workspace">????</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To login with a different username (use <em>admin/admin</em> to be allowed to write to the repository),
            use <a href="system/sling/login">this link</a>.
        </p>
        <script language="javascript">
            var info = Sling.getSessionInfo();
            document.getElementById("username").innerHTML = info.userID;
            document.getElementById("workspace").innerHTML = info.workspace;
        </script>

repository.name = Apache Sling Remote JCR Repository
repository.description = Configuration to access an existing JCR Repository \
 and provide it as a SlingRepository, standard JCR Repository and CRXRepository.

admin.name.name = Administator	
admin.name.description = The user name of the administrative user. This user \
 name is used to implement the SlingRepository.loginAdministrative(String) \
 method. It is intended for this user to provide full read/write access to \
 repository.
 
admin.password.name = Administrator Password	
admin.password.description = Password for the administrative user.

anonymous.name.name = Anonymous	
anonymous.name.description = The user name of the anonymous user. This user \
 name is used to implement the Repository.login methods without a Credentials \
 instance.
 
anonymous.password.name = Anonymous Password	
anonymous.password.description = Password for the anonymous user.

config.name = Configuration File	
config.description = Filename or URL of the configuration file for the embedded \
 JCR repository. The name is first checked, whether it points to a readable file. \
 If no, the name is assumed to be an URL which must be accessible from the Sling \
 Server. \
 
defaultWorkspace.name = Default Workspace
defaultWorkspace.description = Name of the workspace to use by default if not \
 is given in any of the login methods. This name is used to implement the \
 SlingRepository.getDefaultWorkspace() method. If this name is empty, a null \
 value is used in JCR calls so that the default workspace provided by the \
 JCR repository is used.
 
home.name = Repository Home	
home.description = Name of a filesystem directory in which to launch the \
 embedded JCR Repository.
 
poll.active.name = Poll Intervall Active 	
poll.active.description = The interval in seconds between two consecutive \
 checks whether the repository is still accessbible, once it has been acquired.\
 The default value is 10 seconds, the minimum allowed value is 2 seconds, \
 smaller values are corected to the minimum. 
 
poll.inactive.name = Poll Intervall Inactive
poll.inactive.description = The interval in seconds between two consecutive \
 checks whether the repository has become accessbible if the repository is \
 not immediately accessible or connection to the repository has been lost. \
 The default value is 10 seconds, the minimum allowed value is 2 seconds, \
 smaller values are corected to the minimum.
 
pool.maxActive.name = Maximum Sessions	
pool.maxActive.description = The maximum number of sessions which may be logged \
 in through the Sling Repository. This number limits the number of sessions \
 provided by the session pool at any one time. If more sessions are requested \
 the respective threads have to wait for sessions to be logged out by other \
 threads. Default if negative or not set is virtually unlimited. \
 See Session Wait Time.
 
pool.maxActiveWait.name	= Session Wait Time
pool.maxActiveWait.description = The number of seconds to wait for a session \
 to become available if the maximum number of sessions has been provided. If \
 no session becomes available within time frame, access to the repository fails. \
 Default if negative or not set is 10 seconds.
 
pool.maxIdle.name = Maximum Idle Sessions
pool.maxIdle.description = The maximum number of sessions to keep in the pool. \
 The bigger this number, the more sessions are kept in the pool, the more login \
 round trips may be saved. On the other hand, each session requires a certain \
 amount of memory. Default if negative or not set is 10 idle sessions.
 
name.name = Repository Name
name.description = The name under which the repository will be looked up in \

loader.name = Repository Class Loader Factory
loader.description = Configuration for the Repository Class Loader Factory. This \
 configuration applies to all clients of the factory even though each Bundle \
 using the factory retrieves its own factory. The class path of the created \
 Repository Class Loaders is configurable and the class loaders delegate use \
 the bundle asking for the factory as the parent class loader.

classpath.name = Class Path
classpath.description = The class path in the repository to use as the class \
 path for all created Repository Class Loaders. All Class Loaders are configured \
 with the same class path. This class path must include any destinations used \
 by Java compilers writing to the Repository such as the JSP Script Handler, \
 which by default writes to "/var/classes". If no class path is defined, the \
 "/var/classes" folder is used by default.

owner.name = Repository Session User
owner.description = Name of a user owning the Repository Class Loader sessions. \
 If this is empty a simple administrative session is used. Otherwise the \
 administrative session is used to impersonate as the given user.

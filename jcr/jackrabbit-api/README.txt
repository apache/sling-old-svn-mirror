Apache Sling JCR API

This OSGi bundle provides the Jackrabbit API packages.

Disclaimer
==========
Apache Sling is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Jackrabbit PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

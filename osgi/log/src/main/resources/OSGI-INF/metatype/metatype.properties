log.name = Sling Logging Configuration
log.description = Configuration setup for the Sling OSGi LogService \
 implementation
log.level.name = Log Level
log.level.description = Root Logger log level setting.
log.file.name = Log File
log.file.description = The name and path of the log file. If this is empty, \
 logging goes to standard output (the console). If this path is relative it \
 is resolved below ${sling.home}.
log.file.number.name = Number of Log Files
log.file.number.description = The number of log files to keep. When the size of \
 the log file reaches the configured maximum (see Maximum Log File Size), \
 the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This setting specifies \
 how many generations (incl. the active log file) should be kept. This is a \
 positive numeric value. The default value is 5. 
log.file.size.name=Maximum Log File Size
log.file.size.description The maximum size of the log file. If this size is \
 reached the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This size \
 may be specified with size indicators KB, MB and GB. The default is 10MB.
log.pattern.name = Message Pattern
log.pattern.description = Message Pattern for formatting the log messages. \
 This is a java.util.MessageFormat pattern supporting up to five arguments: \
 {0} The timestamp of type java.util.Date, {1} the log marker, {2} the name \
 of the current thread, {3} the name of the logger, {4} the debug level and \
 {5} the actual debug message. If the log call includes a Throwable, the \
 stacktrace is just appended to the message.
 
# Log File configuration is not supported at the moment
# log.url.name = Configuration
# log.url.description = URL to a configuration file. This URL must be \
#  accessible to the Sling server, which is important in the case of file: URLs. \
#  If this property is set and can successfully be used to configure logging, \
#  the other configuration properties are actually ignored. Currently \
#  this setting is ignored alltogether.

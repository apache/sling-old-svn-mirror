jsphandler.name = JSP Script Handler
jsphandler.description The JSP Script Handler supports development of JSP \
 scripts to render response content on behalf of ScriptComponents. Internally \
 Jasper 5.5.20 JSP Engine is used together with the Eclipse Java Compiler to \
 compile generated Java code into Java class files. Some settings of Jasper \
 may be configured as shown below. Note that JSP scripts are expected in the \
 JCR repository and generated Java source and class files will be written to \
 the JCR repository below the configured Compilation Location.  

jasper.checkInterval.name = Compilation Check Interval
jasper.checkInterval.description = If development is false and reloading is \
 true, background compiles are enabled. checkInterval is the time in seconds \
 between checks to see if a JSP page needs to be recompiled. Default 300 seconds.
 
jasper.classdebuginfo.name = Generate Debug Info
jasper.classdebuginfo.description = Should the class file be compiled with \
 debugging information? true or false, default true.
 
jasper.development.name = Development Mode
jasper.development.description = Is Jasper used in development mode (will check \
 for JSP modification on every access)? true or false, default true.
 
jasper.enablePooling.name = Tag Pooling
jasper.enablePooling.description = Determines whether tag handler pooling is \
 enabled. true or false, default true.
 
jasper.ieClassId.name = Plugin Class-ID
jasper.ieClassId.description = The class-id value to be sent to Internet \
 Explorer when using <jsp:plugin> tags. Default \
 clsid:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93.
 
jasper.genStringAsCharArray.name = Char Array Strings
jasper.genStringAsCharArray.description = Should text strings be generated as \
 char arrays, to improve performance in some cases? Default false.
 
jasper.keepgenerated.name = Keep Generated Java
jasper.keepgenerated.description = Should we keep the generated Java source \
 code for each page instead of deleting it? true or false, default true.
 
jasper.mappedfile.name = Mapped Content
jasper.mappedfile.description = Should we generate static content with one \
 print statement per input line, to ease debugging? true or false, default true.
 
jasper.modificationTestInterval.name = Modification Check Interval
jasper.modificationTestInterval.description = Checks for modification for a \
 given JSP file (and all its dependent files) will be performed only once every \
 specified amount of seconds. Setting this to 0 will cause the JSP to be checked \
 on every access. Default is 4 seconds.
 
jasper.reloading.name = Check Modified JSPs
jasper.reloading.description = Should Jasper check for modified JSPs? true or \
 false, default false.
 
jasper.scratchdir.name = Compilation Location
jasper.scratchdir.description = What scratch directory should we use when \
 compiling JSP pages? Default is the work directory for the current web \
 application.
 
jasper.trimSpaces.name = Trim Spaces
jasper.trimSpaces.description = Should white spaces in template text between \
 actions or directives be trimmed ?, default false.

jasper.displaySourceFragments.name = Display Source Fragments
jasper.displaySourceFragments.description = Should we include a source fragment \
 in exception messages, which could be displayed to the developer

Apache Sling Attic
==================

The Sling Attic is a place for retired modules, that we do not expect to develope further.

The Attic is *not here* - this folder is just meant to make it more visible in our main
code repository but the attic is at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/attic/

Modules which are found there _might_ be moved back to our main codebase if someone needs
them and is willing to do the work. Please discuss any such cases on the dev@sling.a.o list.

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65873121 has more information
about a first batch of module retirements that happened in 2016.

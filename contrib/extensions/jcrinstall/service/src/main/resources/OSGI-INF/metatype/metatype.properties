jcrinstall.name = Apache Sling JCR Install
jcrinstall.description = Installs OSGi bundles and configurations found \
 in the JCR Repository. 

bundles.startlevel.name = Start level of installed bundles
bundles.startlevel.description = Bundles installed by jcrinstall are set \
 to this OSGi start level, which should be higher than the start level \

 be equal or higher to the configured value, so that installed bundles are \
 started right after being installed by jcrinstall.

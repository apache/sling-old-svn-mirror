This is a Sling Resource Provider for MongoDB implementation (from 2012)

The Sling provides also a different implementation based on the Generic NoSQL Resource Provider for MongoDB:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/trunk/contrib/nosql/mongodb-resourceprovider

Please note that both implementations are not interchangeable because they store the data in MongoDB in different formats.

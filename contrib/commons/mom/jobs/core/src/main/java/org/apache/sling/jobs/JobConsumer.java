/**
 * Components that implement JobConsumers are registered with the Job Sub System by an OSGi Whiteboard pattern. Once
 * registered the component will be offered jobs matching the job types set as the OSGi property JobConsumer.JOB_TYPES.
 * If the consumer accepts the job, by not throwing and exception on the execute method, it agrees to ensure that the job
 * is executed. It may queue the job, but if queued it must ensure the job is executed. A JobConsumer should check that he
 * dependencies required to execute the job are satisfied before accepting the job for execution. Queueing jobs in the job consumer
 * to ensure that the execution threads of the JobConsumer have work available is ok, but queuing jobs to remove them from
 * the job queue is to be discouraged, as it may require too much from the JobConsumer implementation to guarantee the contract
 * in this interface.

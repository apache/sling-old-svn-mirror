/**
 * Job updates are messages that update the state of the job at all subscribers.
 * The distribution mechanism for JobUpdate messages must ensure that the messages are distributed appropriately so that
 * the queues that contain the messages allow the messages to be acted on in an appropriate manner. For instance if the
 * implementation decides that it will use a message queue to queue jobs as JobUpdate messages, then it may need to
 * put the JobUpdates that start a message on a separate queue from the JobUpdates that update, abort or stop a job, so that
 * those messages do not get delayed by a backlog of job start messages. Alternatively the implementation may decide to implement
 * a scheduler that consumes job start messages at full queue throughput and queue jobs into a separate implementation specific queue.
 * <p>
 * The API does not specify the implementation, only that the various JobUpdate messages are delivered with an delay appropriate for the
 * type of message, identified by the JobUpdateCommand type.

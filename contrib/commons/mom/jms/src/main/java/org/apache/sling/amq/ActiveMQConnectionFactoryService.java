/**
 * Creates a ConnectionFactoryService that makes a pooled  JMS ConnectionFactory available to consumers. The implementation
 * of JMS is provided by ActiveMQ in this instances. If the component is left un-configured it will connection to vm://localhost:6161.
 * If no server is present at that address, the component will create a standalone ActiveMQ broker on startup. Without additional
 * configuration that AMQ Broker will operate standalone. With configuration it is possible to configure the broker to become
 * a member of a multi master AMQ Broker network. Alternatively if a dedicated AMQ Broker is required the jms.brokerUrl configuration
 * setting should be adjusted to point to that broker.
 *
 * This component works OOTB and in Unit tests with no further action.
 *
 * The jms.brokerUrl allows configuration of the broker in any way that ActiveMQ allows, including xbean and broker.
 *
 *
 * Available URI patterns.
 *
 * xbean:org/apache/sling/amq/activemq.xml will result in the Broker searching for org/apache/sling/amq/activemq.xml in
 * the classpath and using that to configure the Borker, see http://activemq.apache.org/xml-configuration.html for details
 * of the format. See that location for an example of the default configuration.
 *
 *
 *
 * broker:tcp://localhost:61616 will create a broker on localhost port 61616 using the URI configuration format.
 * See http://activemq.apache.org/broker-configuration-uri.html and http://activemq.apache.org/broker-uri.html for
 * details of the format.
 *
 * properties:/foo/bar.properties uses a properties file as per http://activemq.apache.org/broker-properties-uri.html

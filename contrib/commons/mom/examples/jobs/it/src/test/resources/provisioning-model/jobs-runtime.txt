  # Configure a queue to listen to the queue used in the IT Services components.
  # In general a queue should only be activated on an instance if the
  # instance is configured with consumers for that queue.
  # If consumers are not present, then the queue will dequeue and force a retry
  # of each item it can process untill the retry limit is reached.

# Open ID Authentication handler 
auth.openid.name = Apache Sling OpenID Authentication Handler
auth.openid.description = The OpenID Authentication Handler authenticates \
 users via OpenID. A default login form is provided by the handler, while \
 custom forms can be provided by configuring the URL (or path) to the \
 login form. To map OpenID identifiers to Repository users it is expected that \
 the Repository users have a property "open.id.identifier" set to the OpenID \
 identifier of the user. This property may be a multi-value 

path.name = Path
path.description = Repository path for which this authentication handler \
 should be used by Sling. If this is empty, the authentication handler will \
 be disabled.

openid.use.cookie.name = Use Cookie 
openid.use.cookie.description = Whether to use a regular Cookie or an HTTP \
 Session to cache the OpenID authentication details. By default a regular \
 cookie is used to prevent use of HTTP Sessions.

openid.cookie.name.name = Cookie name 
openid.cookie.name.description = Name of cookie used to persist authentication. \
 Only used if 'Use Cookie' is checked.

openid.cookie.domain.name = Cookie domain 
openid.cookie.domain.description = Domain of cookie used to persist \
 authentication. This defaults to the host name of the Sling server but may \
 be set to a different value to share the cookie amongst a server farm or \
 if the server is running behind a proxy. Only used if 'Use Cookie' is checked.

openid.cookie.secret.key.name = Cookie Secret Key
openid.cookie.secret.key.description = Secret key used to create a signature \
 of the cookie value to prevent tampering. Only used if 'Use Cookie' is true.

openid.login.form.name = URL of Open ID login form
openid.login.form.description = This should provide a way to capture the \
 user's OpenID identifier.  This is not the OpenID Provider's login page, \
 however, it does not have to be a local URL. If it is a local Sling URL, it \
 must be accessible by the anonymous user. The user is HTTP Redirect'ed to this \
 URL.  This page should POST back the user's OpenID identifier (as named by \
 the "OpenID identifier form field" property) to the originally requested URL \ 
 set in the "resource" request parameter.

openid.login.identifier.name =  OpenID identifier form field
openid.login.identifier.description = The name of the form parameter that \
 provides the user's OpenID identifier. By convention this is \
 'openid_identifier'. Only change this if you have a very good reason to do so.

openid.external.url.prefix.name = External URL prefix 
openid.external.url.prefix.description = The prefix of URLs generated for the \
 ReturnTo and TrustRoot properties of the OpenID request to the OpenID \
 provider. Thus this URL prefix should bring back the authenticated user to \
 this Sling instance. Configuring this property is usually necessary when \
 running Sling behind a proxy (like Apache) since proxy mapping is not \
 performed on the OpenID ReturnTo and TrustRoot URLs as they are sent to the \
 OpenID Provider as form parameters.  If this property is empty, the URLs are \
 generated using the hostname found in the original request.

openid.property.identity.name = OpenID Identity Property 
openid.property.identity.description = The name of the JCR User attribute \
 listing one or more OpenID Identity URLs with which a user is associated. \
 The property may be a multi- or single-valued. To resolve a JCR user ID from \
 an OpenID identity a user is searched who lists the identity in this property. \
 The default value is "openid.identity".

openid.user.attr.name = Credentials Attribute
openid.user.attr.description = Name of the JCR SimpleCredentials attribute to \
 to set with the OpenID User data. This attribute is used by the OpenID \
 LoginModule to validate the OpenID user authentication data. Default is \
 "openid.user".

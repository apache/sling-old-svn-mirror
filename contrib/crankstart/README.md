Sling Crankstart Launcher
=========================

This small and generic OSGi launcher starts a Sling instance (or anything else for that matter)
by interpreting a Sling Provisioning Model at runtime.

The `launcher` module contains examples and integration tests that demonstrate it, and provides 
a runnable jar that's self-explaining if you launch it without any parameters.

The Sling Provisioning Model syntax is described at https://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/slingstart.html

Apache Sling Launchpad JCR App

Standalone Sling JCR Server launching the embedded Jackrabbit Repository.
Note, that this is not the full Sling Application but just the bundles
needed to start the Jackrabbit Repository. For the full Sling
Application look at the Launchpad Application or Launpad Web
Application.


Disclaimer
==========
Apache Sling is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Jackrabbit PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Getting Started
===============

This component uses a Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/) build
environment. It requires a Java 5 JDK (or higher) and Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)
2.0.7 or later. We recommend to use the latest Maven version.

If you have Maven 2 installed, you can compile and
package the jar using the following command:

    mvn package

See the Maven 2 documentation for other build features.

The latest source code for this component is available in the
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) source repository of
the Apache Software Foundation. If you have Subversion installed,
you can checkout the latest source using the following command:

    svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/sling/trunk/launchpad/jcrapp

See the Subversion documentation for other source control features.



How to run this
---------------

1) Build all Sling bundles

  cd <top of the Sling source code tree>
  mvn clean install
  
2) Build the launchpad servlets

  cd launchpad/launchpad-servlets
  mvn clean install
  cd -
  
3) Build and run this

  cd launchpad/launchpad-webapp
  mvn clean package jetty:run
  
Once the webapp starts, http://localhost:8888/sling should display the Sling 
web console.

4) Test node creation and display
To create a node with curl:

	 curl -D - -Ftitle=something http://admin:admin@localhost:8888/testing/this
	 
Then, http://admin:admin@localhost:8888/testing/this should display a default HTML
representation, including the value of the "title" property.

Add a txt or json extension to see other output formats.

Integration tests
-----------------
This module provides a number of integration tests, that run automatically when
doing a full build, and test Sling via its client HTTP interfaces.

These tests can also be run against another instance of Sling, for example to
test it in another web container than the embedded Jetty that is used during the
Maven build.

See pom.xml for the parameters that control these integration tests. Here's an
example of running them against a Sling instance running on host xyzzy, port 1234,
with the Sling webapp mounted under /foo:

   mvn -o -s /dev/null test \
    -Dhttp.port=1234 \
    -Dtest.host=xyzzy \
    -Dhttp.base.path=foo \
    -Dwebdav.workspace.path=foo/dav/default \
    -Dtest=**/integrationtest/**/*Test.java

The  -s /dev/null parameter disables all your local Maven settings, to make sure
they don't interfere. Feel free to remove that if you know what you're doing.

To run a single test, other values can be used for the "-Dtest" parameter.

This is very useful during development: you can leave a Sling webapp instance
running, update bundles in it using the mvn autoInstallBundle profile, and run
specific integration tests quickly from another terminal.

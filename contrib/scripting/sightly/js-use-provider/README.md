Apache Sling Scripting Sightly JavaScript Use Provider
=====================================

This bundle allows Sightly's USE API to access JS scripts. It also wraps Sling's JS engine in a simulated event loop.

The bundle also contains a bindings values provider that adds an API layer accessible from Sightly & JS.

The implementation of that API can be found in `src/main/resources/SLING-INF`.

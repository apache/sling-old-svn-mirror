Apache Sling Testing Sling Mock Jackrabbit-based Resource Resolver

Implements a resource resolver type for Jackrabbit that can be used in unit tests based on Sling Mocks.

This is a separate maven artifacts because it introduces a lot of further dependencies.

Please note: This adapter for Jackrabbit is still experimental, not all sling-mock features are working.

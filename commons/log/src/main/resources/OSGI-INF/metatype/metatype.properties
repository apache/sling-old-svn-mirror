 how many generations (incl. the active log file) should be kept. This is a \
 positive numeric value. The default value is 5. 
log.file.size.name=Maximum Log File Size
log.file.size.description The maximum size of the log file. If this size is \
 reached the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This size \

 The indicator can either be specificed lower or upper case (e.g. KB or kb).

 {0} The timestamp of type java.util.Date, {1} the log marker, {2} the name \
 of the current thread, {3} the name of the logger, {4} the debug level and \
 {5} the actual debug message. If the log call includes a Throwable, the \
 stacktrace is just appended to the message.
 
log.factory.writer.name = Apache Sling Logging Writer Configuration
log.factory.writer.description = Configure a Logger Writer for Sling Logging
 
log.factory.config.name = Apache Sling Logging Logger Configuration
log.factory.config.description = Configure Loggers with levels, pattern and \
 destination
log.loggers.name = Categories
log.loggers.description = The categories applicable for this logger \
 configuration. Each category applies for any child category unless configured \
 otherwise. E.g. a category of org.apache.sling applies to category \
 org.apache.sling.commons unless there is a different configuration for \
 org.apache.sling.commons.

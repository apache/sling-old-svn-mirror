Apache Sling
============

Bringing Back the Fun!

Apache Sling (currently in incubation) is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository,
such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage content.

Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on simple name conventions,
to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.

The embedded Apache Felix OSGi framework and console provide a dynamic runtime environment, where 
code and content bundles can be loaded, unloaded and reconfigured at runtime.

As the first web framework dedicated to JSR-170 Java Content Repositories, Sling makes it very simple
to implement simple applications, while providing an enterprise-level framework for more complex applications.

See http://incubator.apache.org/sling for more information.


Disclaimer
==========
Apache Sling is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Jackrabbit PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

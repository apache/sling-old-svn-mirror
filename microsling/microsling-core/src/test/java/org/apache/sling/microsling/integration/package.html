    The tests found in and under this package are used in the 
    "integration-test" build phase (SLING-82), they are not run 
    as part of the normal "test" build phase. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To debug the integration tests, however, it is useful to run
    them as part of the normal test phase, after starting a separate
    microsling instance that they can talk to.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is implemented using Maven profiles: to run the integration
    tests during the normal test phase, disable the "disableIntegrationTestsInTestPhase"
    Maven profile, for example using <code>mvn -P nullMicroslingProfile test</code>.
    See pom.xml for more details.

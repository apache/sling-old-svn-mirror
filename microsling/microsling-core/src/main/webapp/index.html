  <h1>&micro;sling homepage</h1>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  	&micro;sling (pronounced <em>microsling</em>) started as "back to basics" rewrite of Sling, which is heavier, using OSGi, and
  	at the time was much harder to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
  	As I write this (early December 2007), &micro;sling is perfectly usable to create scripted 
  	JCR-based applications (it runs <a href="http://dev.day.com">dev.day.com</a> for example). 
  	We have decided to focus on javascript, using it for either server-side
  	or client side templates (see links below), or for handling other HTTP requests besides GET.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The ujax.js client-side javascript library provides a simple javascript "proxy" on the
  	JCR repository. The name ujax should really by written &micro;jax (<em>microjax</em>), but for all
    filenames and technical names (parameters etc.) with use "ujax" to avoid encoding problems.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Documentation and examples are scarce for now, but the automated tests (both unit and integration tests)
  	are extensive and up to date, if you can read simple java code they might help. 
  </p>

  <h2>more test links</h2>
  <p>
  	Script engines are (almost) pluggable, so we support various templating and scripting languages.
  	But our focus is definitely on javascript, as it allows using the same language on both the server
  	and client sides.

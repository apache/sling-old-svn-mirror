This module generates a zip file that, once expanded, allows
microsling to run standalone, using the Jetty web server's
start.jar utility.

To build the zip file, run "mvn install" here, after building
the microsling core if needed (in ../microsling-core).

To run microsling, see the README.txt found in the generated
zip file.

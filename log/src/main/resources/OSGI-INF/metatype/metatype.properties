 implementation
log.level.name = Log Level
log.level.description = Root Logger log level setting.
log.file.name = Log File
log.file.description = The name and path of the log file. If this is empty, \
 logging goes to standard output (the console). If this path is relative it \
 is resolved below ${sling.home}.
log.pattern.name = Message Pattern
log.pattern.description = Message Pattern for the Pattern Layout. See \
 http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout for more \
 information on the pattern.

log.url.description = URL to a Logback configuration file. This URL must be \
 accessible to the Sling server, which is important in the case of file: URLs. \
 If this property is set and the configuration file succeeds configuring \
 Logback, the other configuration properties are actually ignored.

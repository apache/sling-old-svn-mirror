### ui.apps Example

#### Introduction

This is a Content Package rather than an OSGi Content Bundle meaning
that JCR Nodes are described with **.content.xml** files rather than with
**.json** files. This example provides a content node home page together
with the Home and Page resource type HTML code.

#### Dependencies

This content package depends on the Sling Model **SampleRequestModel**
from the **core.example**.

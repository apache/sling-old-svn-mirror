/**
 * The <code>FileRequestLog</code> class is an implementation of the
 * {@link RequestLog} interface writing the log messages to an plain file. This
 * class supports sharing the files for different log formatters, in that an
 * internal map of log files is kept and access to the <code>PrintWriter</code>s
 * to write to the file is synchronized.
 * <p>
 * This class has a defined lifecycle to ensure correct operation: Before using
 * the class to instantiate it, the {@link #init(String)} method should be
 * called mainly to set the root directory for relative log file paths. It is
 * not recommended to call the {@link #init(String)} method multiple times. When
 * the class is not used any more the {@link #dispose()} method should be called
 * to clean up, namely to close all open files. This lifecycle behaviour is
 * forced by the {@link RequestLoggerFilter} component, which calls the
 * {@link #init(String)} method on filter component activation and calls the
 * {@link #dispose()} metod on filter component deactivation.
 * <p>
 * Note: Currently, each log file is kept open from the moment the log file is
 * first moment until the {@link #dispose()} method is called. Future
 * development should probably focus on the following issues: (1) Implement an
 * open/write/close cycle when logging a message, (2) close log files when the
 * last user has closed the log, (3) optimize the first strategy by keeping the
 * files open for some time.
 * <p>
 * Note: Currently, the <code>PrintWriter</code> used to log the message is
 * flushed after each log message written. Future development should probably
 * implement better buffering in conjunction with the temporary open/close
 * cycles of the files.

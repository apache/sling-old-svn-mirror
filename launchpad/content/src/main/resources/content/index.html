	    <h1>Welcome to the Sling Launchpad</h1>
	    
		<p>
			Apache Sling (currently in incubation) is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository, 
			such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage content.

			Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on simple name conventions, 
			to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.

			The embedded Apache Felix OSGi framework and <a href="system/console">console</a> provide a dynamic 
			runtime environment, where code and content bundles can be loaded, unloaded and reconfigured at runtime.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	The Sling Launchpad is a ready-to-run Sling configuration, providing an embedded 
	    	JCR content repository and web server, a selection of Sling components, and 
	    	documentation and examples. The Launchpad makes it easy to get started with Sling 
	    	and to develop script-based applications.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>
			To get started with Sling, see our
			<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling">website</a> and
			the 
			<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/discover-sling-in-15-minutes.html">
			Sling in 15 minutes
			</a>
			tutorial.
		</p>    	
		<p>
			Note that you can mount the repository via WebDAV to explore or modify content,
			simply use the <a href="./">root URL</a> as the WebDAV server URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use our 
			<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/project-information.html#ProjectInformation-lists">

        	Any init-params defined for the servlet will overwrite
            the default settings in the sling.properties file.
            
            The most important init-param to be set here is the 
            sling.home parameter defining where Sling will place
            its files such as the bundle cache, logs, configuration,
            etc.
            
            If the sling.home parameter is not set a default value is
            set as ${user.dir}/sling/${context.path} where ${user.dir}
            is the current working directory and ${context.path} is the
            servlet context path with slashes replaced by underscores and
            the root context represented as just a single underscore.
            
            Example: For Sling deployed in the root context, the default
            sling.home would be sling/_. For Sling deployed in the context
            /sling/i1, the default sling.home would be sling/_sling_i1.

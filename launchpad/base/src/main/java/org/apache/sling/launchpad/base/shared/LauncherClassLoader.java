/**
 * The <code>LauncherClassLoader</code> extends the standard Java VM
 * <code>URLClassLoader</code> such, that classes and resources which are
 * contained in the launcher JAR File are never looked up in the parent class
 * loader.
 * <p>
 * This class loader shields the Sling OSGi framework completely from the
 * environment because
 * <ul>
 * <li>Classes and resources contained in packages provided by the launcher JAR
 * file are only looked up in the launcher JAR file</li>
 * <li>Classes and resources from the environment are only used from within the
 * framework if the framework is configured to do so by the
 * <code>org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation</code> or
 * <code>org.osgi.framework.systempackages</code> framework properties.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The first point is important if Sling is deployed into any container, which
 * provides some or all of the same packages as the Sling launcher JAR file. One
 * such example is the Glassfish v3 Prelude application service, which itself
 * runs in a Felix OSGi framework and sort of leaks the classes into the web
 * application.
 * <p>
 * In the general case, we cannot prevent any leaking of classes, which may also
 * be the OSGi core or compendium libraries, into Sling. So, this class loader
 * is the barrier for this leaking and shields Sling from the environment unless
 * explicitly configured to use this leaking.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class loader are setup with the launcher JAR file as the
 * only contents of the <code>URLClassLoaders</code> class path and the class
 * loader of this class itself as the parent class loader.

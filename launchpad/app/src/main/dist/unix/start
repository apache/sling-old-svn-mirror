# This script configures the start information for Sling
#
# The following environment variables may be used to override the default
# defined in the HTTP Service implementation:
#
#     % SLING_PORT=56000 ./start
#
# this script is a quick wrapper for the main 'serverctl' script which
# has a lot more options. see
#
# serverctl --help
#
# for details.
#

# override the java home for use by Apache Sling
# JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_14"

# override the port which Sling should bind to
SLING_PORT='8080'

# override the interface which communique should listen to
# this setting is not currently supported
# SLING_INTERFACE='0.0.0.0'

# override the initial log-level prior to reading the configuration
# this overwrites the setting in the sling.properties file and is overwritten
# by the LogService configuration. Use any string of DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
# ERROR and FATAL. Default is INFO.
#SLING_LOGLEVEL='INFO'

# override the initial heap size in mb for use by Sling
#SLING_HEAP_MIN='128'

# override the maximum heap size in mb for use by Sling
#SLING_HEAP_MAX='256'

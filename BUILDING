How to build Sling
------------------
Requires a Java 5 JDK and Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) 2.0.7 or later.

To build Sling, run

  mvn clean install

in this directory. This will build, test and install the Sling modules
in your local Maven repository.

Some modules might not be listed in the pom.xml found in this directory,
those won't be built by the above command. If you need one of these 
modules, run "mvn clean install" in the directory that contains its
pom.xml file.

To get started with Sling, start the launchpad/launchpad-webapp module,
see README.txt in that module's directory.

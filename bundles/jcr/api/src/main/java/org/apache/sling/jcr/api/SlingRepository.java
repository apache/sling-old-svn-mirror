/**
 * The <code>SlingRepository</code> extends the standard JCR repository
 * interface with two methods: {@link #getDefaultWorkspace()} and
 * {@link #loginAdministrative(String)}. This method ease the use of a JCR
 * repository in a Sling application in that the default (or standard) workspace
 * to use by the application may be configured and application bundles may use a
 * simple method to get an administrative session instead of being required to
 * provide their own configuration of administrative session details.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface will generally provide configurability of
 * the default workspace name as well as the access details for the
 * administrative session.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of SlingRepository are expected to invoke any available
 * implementations of the {@link NamespaceMapper} interface <b>before</b>
 * returning <b>any</b> {@link Session} to callers. This includes the methods
 * defined in the {@link Repository} interface.

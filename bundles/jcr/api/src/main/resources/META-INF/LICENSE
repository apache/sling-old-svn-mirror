      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS

   1. License for Purposes of Evaluation and Developing Applications. Licensor
   hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
   limited license (without the right to sublicense), under Licensor's
   applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use and
   reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal evaluation.
   This includes developing applications intended to run on an implementation
   of the Specification provided that such applications do not themselves
   implement any portion(s) of the Specification.

   2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor also
   grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully
   paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense)
   under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection
   4 below, patent rights it may have covering the Specification to create
   and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification that:
   (a) fully implements the Specification including all its required
   interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify, subset, superset or
   otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or
   protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within
   the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the
   Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) passes the
   Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements of the
   applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification ("Compliant
   Implementation"). In addition, the foregoing license is expressly
   conditioned on your not acting outside its scope. No license is granted
   hereunder for any other purpose (including, for example, modifying the
   Specification, other than to the extent of your fair use rights, or
   distributing the Specification to third parties).

   3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from
   the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through" requirements
   in any license You grant concerning the use of your Independent
   Implementation or products derived from it. However, except with respect
   to Independent Implementations (and products derived from them) that
   satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither:
   (a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any licenses under
   Licensor's applicable intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your
   licensees to make any claims concerning their implementation's compliance
   with the Specification.

   4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses. With respect to any patent
   claims covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that
   would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the
   Specification, such license is conditioned upon your offering on fair,
   reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You,
   a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your
   patent rights that are or would be infringed by all technically feasible
   implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a
   Compliant Implementation.

   5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent
   Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
   neither derives from any of Licensor's source code or binary code materials
   nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Licensor,
   includes any of Licensor's source code or binary code materials; "Licensor
   Name Space" shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose
   names begin with "java", "javax", "javax.jcr" or their equivalents in any
   subsequent naming convention adopted by Licensor through the Java Community
   Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof; and
   "Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and
   accompanying TCK User's Guide provided by Licensor which corresponds to
   the particular version of the Specification being tested.

   6. Termination. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
   from Licensor if you fail to comply with any material provision of or act
   outside the scope of the licenses granted above.

   7. Trademarks. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks,
   service marks, or trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is
   a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and
   other countries.

   8. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Specification is provided "AS IS".
   LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A
   CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION),
   OR THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE.
   This document does not represent any commitment to release or implement
   any portion of the Specification in any product.

   The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical
   errors. Changes are periodically added to the information therein; these
   changes will be incorporated into new versions of the Specification, if
   any. Licensor may make improvements and/or changes to the product(s)
   and/or the program(s) described in the Specification at any time. Any use
   of such changes in the Specification will be governed by the then-current
   license for the applicable version of the Specification.

   9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
   EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
   CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
   REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
   FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN
   IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   10. Report. If you provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in
   connection with your use of the Specification ("Feedback"), you hereby:
   (i) agree that such Feedback is provided on a non-proprietary and
   non-confidential basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual, non-exclusive,
   worldwide, fully paid-up, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense
   through multiple levels of sublicensees, to incorporate, disclose, and use
   without limitation the Feedback for any purpose related to the
   Specification and future versions, implementations, and test suites thereof.

 * ResourceProvider with a path (like provider.roots). If different
 * ResourceAccessGateService services match a path, not only the
 * ResourceAccessGateService with the longest path should be called, but all of
 * them, that's in contrast to the ResourceProvider, but in this case more
 * logical (and secure!).
 * 
 * service properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>path</b>: regexp to define on which paths the service should be called
 * (default .*)</li>
 * <li><b>operations</b>: set of operations on which the service should be
 * called ("read,create,update,delete,execute", default all of them)</li>
 * <li><b>finaloperations</b>: set of operations on which the service answer is
 * final an no other service should be called (default none of them)</li>

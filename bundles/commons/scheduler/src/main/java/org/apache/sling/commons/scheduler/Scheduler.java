/**
 * A scheduler to schedule time/cron based jobs.
 * A job is an object that is executed/fired by the scheduler. The object
 * should either implement the {@link Job} interface or the {@link Runnable}
 * interface.
 *
 * A job can be scheduled either by creating a {@link ScheduleOptions} instance
 * through one of the scheduler methods and then calling {@link #schedule(Object, ScheduleOptions)}
 * or
 * by using the whiteboard pattern and registering a Runnable service with either
 * the {@link #PROPERTY_SCHEDULER_EXPRESSION} or {@link #PROPERTY_SCHEDULER_PERIOD}
 * property. Services registered by the whiteboard pattern can by default run concurrently,
 * which usually is not wanted. Therefore it is advisable to also set the
 * {@link #PROPERTY_SCHEDULER_CONCURRENT} property with Boolean.FALSE.
 *
 * Jobs started through  the scheduler API are not persisted and are not
 * restarted after a bundle restart. If the client bundle is stopped, the scheduler
 * will stop all jobs started by this bundle as well. However, the client bundle does
 * not need to keep a reference to the scheduler service.

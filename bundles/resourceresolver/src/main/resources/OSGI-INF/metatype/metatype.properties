# Localizations for JcrResourceResolverFactoryImpl configuration
resource.resolver.name = Apache Sling JCR Resource Resolver
resource.resolver.description =  Configures the JCR Resource Resolver for request \
 URL and resource path rewriting.

resource.resolver.map.location.name = Mapping Location
resource.resolver.map.location.description = The path to the root of the \
 configuration to setup and configure the ResourceResolver mapping. The \
 default value is /etc/map.

resource.resolver.allowDirect.name = Allow Direct Mapping
resource.resolver.allowDirect.description = Whether to add a direct URL \
 mapping to the front of the mapping list.

resource.resolver.virtual.name = Virtual URLs
resource.resolver.virtual.description = List of virtual URLs and there \
 mappings to real URLs. Format is <externalURL>:<internalURL>. Mappings are \
 applied on the complete request URL only.

resource.resolver.mapping.name = URL Mappings
resource.resolver.mapping.description = List of mappings to apply to URLs. \
 Incoming mappings are applied to request URLs to map to Content paths, \
 outgoing mappings are applied to map Content paths to URLs used on subsequent \
 requests. Form ist <externalURLPrefix><op><internalURLPrefix> where <op> is \
 ">" for incoming mappings, "<" for outgoing mappings and ":" for mappings \
 applied in both directions. Mappings are applied in configuration order by \
 comparing and replacing URL prefixes. Note: The use of "-" as the <op> value \
 indicating a mapping in both directions is deprecated.

resource.resolver.searchpath.name = Resource Search Path
resource.resolver.searchpath.description = The list of absolute path prefixes \
 applied to find resources whose path is just specified with a relative path. \
 The default value is [ "/apps", "/libs" ]. If an empty path is specified a \
 single entry path of [ "/" ] is assumed.

resource.resolver.manglenamespaces.name = Namespace Mangling
resource.resolver.manglenamespaces.description = Defines whether namespace \
 prefixes of resource names inside the path (e.g. "jcr:" in "/home/path/jcr:content") \
 are mangled or not. Mangling means that any namespace prefix contained in the \
 path is replaced as per the generic substitution pattern "/([^:]+):/_$1_/" \
 when calling the "map" method of the resource resolver. Likewise the \
 "resolve" methods will unmangle such namespace prefixes according to the \
 substituation pattern "/_([^_]+)_/$1:/". This feature is provided since \
 there may be systems out there in the wild which cannot cope with URLs \
 containing colons, even though they are perfectly valid characters in the \
 path part of URI references with a scheme. The default value of this property \
 if no configuration is provided is "true".

resource.resolver.multiworkspace.name=Enable Multi Workspaces
resource.resolver.multiworkspace.description=If this is enabled, multiple workspaces are supported \
 This includes registering observation listeners for all workspaces and allows to \
 resolve resources from other workspaces than the default one.

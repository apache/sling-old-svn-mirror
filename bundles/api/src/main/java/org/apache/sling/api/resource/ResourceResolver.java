/**
 * The <code>ResourceResolver</code> defines the service API which may be used
 * to resolve {@link Resource} objects. The resource resolver is available to
 * the request processing servlet through the
 * {@link org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest#getResourceResolver()}
 * method.
 * A resource resolver can also be created through the {@link ResourceResolverFactory}.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ResourceResolver</code> is also an {@link Adaptable} to get
 * adapters to other types. A JCR based resource resolver might support adapting
 * to the JCR Session used by the resolver to access the JCR Repository.
 * <p>
 * A <code>ResourceResolver</code> is generally not thread safe! As a
 * consequence, an application which uses the resolver, its returned resources
 * and/or objects resulting from adapting either the resolver or a resource,
 * must provide proper synchronization to ensure no more than one thread
 * concurrently operates against a single resolver, resource or resulting
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * <b>Accessing Resources</b>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines two kinds of methods to access resources: The
 * <code>resolve</code> methods and the <code>getResource</code> methods. The
 * difference lies in the algorithm applied to find the requested resource and
 * in the behavior in case a resource cannot be found:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Method Kind</th>
 * <th>Access Algorithm</th>
 * <th>Missing Resource</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>resolve</td>
 * <td>Path is always assumed to be absolute. Uses elaborate resource resolution
 * algorithm. This kind of method is intended to resolve request URLs to
 * resources.</td>
 * <td>Returns {@link NonExistingResource}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>getResource</td>
 * <td>Directly access resources with absolute path. For relative paths, the
 * {@link #getSearchPath() search path} is applied. This method is intended to
 * be used by request processing scripts to access further resources as
 * required.</td>
 * <td>Returns <code>null</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * <b>Lifecycle</b>
 * <p>
 * A Resource Resolver has a life cycle which begins with the creation of the
 * Resource Resolver using any of the factory methods and ends with calling the
 * {@link #close()} method. It is very important to call the {@link #close()}
 * method once the resource resolver is not used any more to ensure any system
 * resources are properly cleaned up.
 * <p>
 * To check whether a Resource Resolver can still be used, the {@link #isLive()}
 * method can be called.
 * <p>
 * A <code>ResourceResolver</code> is only valid for as long as the
 * <code>ResourceResolverFactory</code> that created this instance exists. The
 * same applies in general to all objects returned by this instance,
 * especially for all resources. If the <code>ResourceResolverFactory</code>
 * does not exist anymore, the resource resolver instances becomes invalid.
 * <p>
 * <b>Resource Resolver Attributes</b>
 * <p>
 * The authentication info properties provided to the
 * {@link ResourceResolverFactory#getResourceResolver(Map)},
 * {@link ResourceResolverFactory#getAdministrativeResourceResolver(Map)}, or
 * {@link #clone(Map)} are available through the {@link #getAttributeNames()}
 * and {@link #getAttribute(String)} methods with the exception of security
 * sensitive properties like {@link ResourceResolverFactory#PASSWORD} which is
 * not exposed.

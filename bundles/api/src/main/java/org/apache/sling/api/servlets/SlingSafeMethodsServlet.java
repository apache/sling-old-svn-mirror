/**
 * Helper base class for read-only Servlets used in Sling. This base class is
 * actually just a better implementation of the Servlet API <em>HttpServlet</em>
 * class which accounts for extensibility. So extensions of this class have
 * great control over what methods to overwrite.
 * <p>
 * If any of the default HTTP methods is to be implemented just overwrite the
 * respective doXXX method. If additional methods should be supported implement
 * appropriate doXXX methods and overwrite the
 * {@link #mayService(SlingHttpServletRequest, SlingHttpServletResponse)} method
 * to dispatch to the doXXX methods as appropriate and overwrite the
 * {@link #getAllowedRequestMethods(Map)} to add the new method names.
 * <p>
 * Please note, that this base class is intended for applications where data is
 * only read. As such, this servlet by itself does not support the <em>POST</em>,
 * <em>PUT</em> and <em>DELETE</em> methods. Extensions of this class should
 * either overwrite any of the doXXX methods of this class or add support for
 * other read-only methods only. Applications wishing to support data
 * modification should rather use or extend the {@link SlingAllMethodsServlet}
 * which also contains support for the <em>POST</em>, <em>PUT</em> and
 * <em>DELETE</em> methods. This latter class should also be overwritten to
 * add support for HTTP methods modifying data.
 * <p>
 * Implementors note: The methods in this class are all declared to throw the
 * exceptions according to the intentions of the Servlet API rather than
 * throwing their Sling RuntimeException counter parts. This is done to ease the
 * integration with traditional servlets.

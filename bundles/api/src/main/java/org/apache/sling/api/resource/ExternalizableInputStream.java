 * This interface is normally used to extend an InputStream to indicate that it has a URI form that could
 * be used in place of the InputStream if desired. It is used in situations where the internal of a ResourceProvider
 * wants to offload IO to channels that do not pass through the JVM. The URI that is returned may have restrictions
 * imposed on it requiring it to be used immediately. Do not store the URI for later usage as it will, in most cases,
 * have expired.
 *
 * This interface was introduced in 2.10.2 of this package to allow an Oak DataStore to provide a URI form of a DataStore
 * binary where it decided that was appropriate.

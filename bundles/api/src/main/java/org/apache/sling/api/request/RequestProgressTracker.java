/**
 * The <code>RequestProgressTracker</code> class provides the functionality to
 * track the progress of request processing. Instances of this class are
 * provided through the
 * {@link org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest#getRequestProgressTracker()}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * The following functionality is provided:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Track the progress of request processing through the
 * {@link #log(String)} and {@link #log(String, Object...)} methods.
 * <li>Ability to measure and track processing times of parts of request
 * processing through the {@link #startTimer(String)},
 * {@link #logTimer(String)} and {@link #logTimer(String, String, Object...)}
 * methods.
 * <li>Dumping the recording messages through the {@link #dump(PrintWriter)}
 * method.
 * <li>Return the log messages through the {@link #getMessages()} method.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <b>Tracking Request Processing</b>
 * <p>
 * As the request being processed, certain steps may be tracked by calling
 * either of the <code>log</code> methods. A tracking entry consists of a time
 * stamp managed by this class and a tracking message noting the actual step
 * being tracked.
 * <p>
 * <b>Timing Processing Steps</b>
 * </p>
 * Certain steps during request processing may need to be timed in that the time
 * required for processing should be recorded. Instances of this class maintain
 * a map of named timers. Each timer is started (initialized or reset) by
 * calling the {@link #startTimer(String)} method. This method just records the
 * starting time of the named timer and adds a tracking entry with the timer
 * name as the message.
 * <p>
 * To record the number of milliseconds elapsed since a timer has been started,
 * the {@link #logTimer(String)} or {@link #logTimer(String, String, Object...)}
 * method may be called. This method logs a tracking entry with a message
 * consisting of the name of the timer and the number of milliseconds elapsed
 * since the timer was last {@link #startTimer(String) started}. The
 * <code>logTimer</code> methods may be called multiple times to record
 * several timed steps.
 * <p>
 * Calling the {@link #startTimer(String)} method with the name of timer which
 * already exists, resets the start time of the named timer to the current
 * system time.
 * <p>
 * <b>Retrieving Tracking Entries</b>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #dump(PrintWriter)} method may be used to write the tracking
 * entries to the given <code>PrintWriter</code> to for example log them in a
 * HTML comment. Alternatively the tracking entries may be retrieved as an
 * iterator of messages through the {@link #getMessages()} method. The
 * formatting of the tracking entries is implementation specific.

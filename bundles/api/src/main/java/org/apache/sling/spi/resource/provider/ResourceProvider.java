/**
 * API for providers of resources. Used by the {@link ResourceResolver} to
 * transparently access resources from different locations such as a JCR
 * repository, a database, or bundle resources.
 * <p>
 * This extension point is defined by an abstract class (in contrast to
 * an interface) as this will allow to add new functionality in new versions
 * without breaking any implementation.
 * <p>
 * This service is intended to be implemented by providers of resource
 * instances on behalf of the {@link ResourceResolver}. It
 * is not intended to be used by client applications directly. A resource
 * provider implements this service by extending this class.
 * <p>
 * A resource provider must set the {@link #PROPERTY_ROOT} property with an
 * absolute path. This is the mount point of the resource provider. If there
 * is more than one provider registering for the same root, only the one
 * with the highest service ranking is used.
 * <p>
 * If a provider is used in the resource tree, it gets activated through
 * a call of the {@link #activate(ProviderContext)} method. If the
 * provider is not used anymore within the resource tree, the
 * {@link #deactivate(ProviderContext)} method is called. Whenever
 * information concerning the provider is changed while the provider
 * is used, the {@link #update(ProviderContext)} method is called.
 * <p>
 * Some resource providers might require (user) authentication. For example
 * the JCR resource provider uses authenticated sessions. If a provider
 * requires authentication it must indicate this by setting the service
 * registration property {@link #PROPERTY_AUTHENTICATE} to either
 * {@link #AUTHENTICATE_LAZY} or {@link #AUTHENTICATE_REQUIRED}. In these
 * cases, the resource resolver calls {@link #authenticate(Map)} and on
 * successful authentication the provider returns a state object for
 * the current user. This object is passed into the provider with
 * every method through {@link ResolveContext#getProviderState()}.
 * If a provider requires authentication, the {@link #logout(Object)} method
 * is called, when the resource resolver is closed.
 * <p>
 * Each method gets the {@link ResolveContext} which gives access to
 * further functionality.
 * <p>

 * TODO - observation

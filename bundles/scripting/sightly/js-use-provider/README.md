Apache Sling Scripting HTL JavaScript Use Provider
==================================================

This bundle allows HTL's Use API to access JS scripts. It also wraps Sling's JS engine in a simulated event loop.

The bundle also contains a bindings values provider that adds an API layer accessible from HTL & JS. The implementation of that API can be found in `src/main/resources/SLING-INF`.

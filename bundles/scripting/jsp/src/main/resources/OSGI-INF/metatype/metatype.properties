jsphandler.description The JSP Script Handler supports development of JSP \
 scripts to render response content on behalf of ScriptComponents. Internally \
 Jasper 5.5.20 JSP Engine is used together with the Eclipse Java Compiler to \
 compile generated Java code into Java class files. Some settings of Jasper \
 may be configured as shown below. Note that JSP scripts are expected in the \
 JCR repository and generated Java source and class files will be written to \
 the JCR repository below the configured Compilation Location.

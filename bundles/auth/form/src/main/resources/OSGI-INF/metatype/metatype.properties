auth.form.name=Apache Sling Form Based Authentication Handler
auth.form.description=This handler extracts a hash value from a cookie or  \
 session attribute id and compares it to a hash generated on the server.

path.name = Path
path.description = Repository path for which this authentication handler \
 should be used by Sling. If this is empty, the authentication handler will \
 be disabled.

form.login.form.name = Login Form
form.login.form.description = The URL (without any context path prefix) to \
 redirect the client to to present the login form. The default value is \
 "/system/sling/form/login".

form.auth.storage.name = Hash Storage
form.auth.storage.description = The type of storage used to provide the \
 authentication state. Valid values are cookie and session. The default value \
 (cookie) also applies if any setting other than the supported values is \
 configured.

form.auth.name.name = Cookie/Attribute Name
form.auth.name.description = The name of the Cookie or HTTP Session attribute \
 providing the authentication state. The default value is "sling.formauth".

 attribute used  to provide the authentication data to the LoginModulePlugin. \
 The default value is "sling.formauth".

form.auth.timeout.name = Timeout
form.auth.timeout.description = The number of minutes after which a login \
 session times out. This value is used as the expiry time set in the \

 a value less than 1, the default value is used instead.

form.token.file.name = Security Token File
form.token.file.description = The name of the file used to persist the \
 security tokens. The default value is cookie-tokens.bin. This property \
 currently refers to a file stored in the file system. If the path is a \
 relative path, the file is either stored in the Authentication Handler bundle \
 private data area or - if not possible - below the location indicated by the \

 working directory. In the future this file may be store in the JCR Repository \
 to support clustering scenarios.

form.use.include.name = Include Form
form.use.include.description = If true, this authentication handler will attempt \
 to include a Servlet resource at the login form path. If false, a redirect will \
 be used instead.

form.onexpire.login.name = On Login Expire, Re-login
form.onexpire.login.description = If true, when the form login expires the user \
 will be prompted to re-login. If false they become an anonymous user. The default \

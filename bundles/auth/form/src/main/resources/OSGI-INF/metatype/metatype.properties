auth.form.name=Apache Sling Form Based Authentication Handler
auth.form.description=This handler extracts a hash value from a cookie or  \
 session attribute id and compares it to a hash generated on the server.

 should be used by Sling. If this is empty, the authentication handler will \
 be disabled.

form.login.form.name = Login Form
form.login.form.description = The URL (without any context path prefix) to \
 redirect the client to to present the login form. The default value is \
 "/system/sling/form/login".

form.auth.storage.name = Hash Storage
form.auth.storage.description = The type of storage used to provide the \
 authentication state. Valid values are cookie and session. The default value \
 (cookie) also applies if any setting other than the supported values is \
 configured.

 providing the authentication state. The default value is "sling.formauth".

 attribute used  to provide the authentication data to the LoginModulePlugin. \
 The default value is "sling.formauth".

form.token.file.name = Security Token File
form.token.file.description = The name of the file used to persist the \

 currently refers to a file stored in the file system. If the path is a \

 working directory. In the future this file may be store in the JCR Repository \
 to support clustering scenarios.

form.token.fastseed.name = Fast Seed Generator
form.token.fastseed.description = Defines whether the random number generator \
 should be seeded with a fast but less secure method. If this property is not \

/**
 * The ClusterSyncService can be used to establish strong
 * consistency with the underlying (eventually consistent) repository in use.
 * <p>
 * The issue is described in length in SLING-4627 - the short
 * version is composed of two different factors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>concurrency of discovery service and its listeners on the 
 * different instances: upon a change in the topology it is 
 * important that one listener doesn't do activity based on
 * an older incarnation of the topologyView than another listener
 * on another instance. they should change from one view to the
 * next view based on the same repository state.</li>
 * </li>
 * <li>when an instance leaves the cluster (eg crashes), then 
 * depending on the repository it might have left a backlog around
 * which would yet have to be processed and which could contain
 * relevant topology-dependent data that should be waited for
 * to settle before the topology-dependent activity can continue
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Both of these two aspects are handled by this ClusterSyncService.
 * The former one by introducing a 'sync token' that gets written
 * to the repository and on receiving it by the peers they know
 * that the writing instance is aware of the ongoing change, that
 * the writing instance has sent out TOPOLOGY_CHANGING and that
 * the receiving instance has seen all changes that the writing
 * instance did prior to sending a TOPOLOGY_CHANGING.
 * The latter aspect is achieved by making use of the underlying
 * repository: eg on Oak the 'discovery lite' descriptor is
 * used to determine if any instance not part of the new view
 * is still being deactivated (eg has backlog). So this second
 * part is repository dependent.

     * declares successful completion - at which point it calls the
     * callback.run().

     * @param callback the runnable which should be called after

/**
 * This listener facade applies a 'startup delay' to a topology event handler,
 * that is, it allows to specify a startup time during which any topology events
 * will be queued and processing only starts after this time.
 * <p>
 * What happens aFter the startup time depends on what was received during the delay:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>if no events were received then this is a no-op</li>
 *  <li>if the last event received was a CHANGING then this facade
 *      waits until it receives the next non-CHANGING event (which should
 *      be the very next), to then simulate an INIT event
 *      (as the discovery API says the first event received is an INIT event).
 *      </li>
 *  <li>if the last event received was not a CHANGING event
 *      (ie it was an INIT, CHANGED or PROPERTIES), then
 *      as soon as the startup time passes this facade will simulate
 *      an INIT event
 *      (again, as the discovery API says the first event received is an INIT event)
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that users of this facade must call dispose to avoid any async calls
 * to the delegate after startup, in case they themselves are deactivated!

/**
 * A job consumer consumes a job.
 *
 * A job consumer registers itself with the {@link #PROPERTY_TOPICS} service registration
 * property. The value of this property defines which topics a consumer is able to process.
 * Each string value of this property is either a job topic or a topic category ending
 * with "/*" which means all topics in this category.
 * For example, the value "org/apache/sling/jobs/*" matches the topics
 * "org/apache/sling/jobs/a" and "org/apache/sling/jobs/b" but neither
 * "org/apache/sling/jobs" nor "org/apache/sling/jobs/subcategory/a"
 *
 * If there is more than one job consumer registered for a job topic, the selection is as
 * follows:
 * - If there is a single consumer registering for the exact topic, this one is used
 * - If there is more than a single consumer registering for the exact topic, the one
 *   with the highest service ranking is used. If the ranking is equal, the one with
 *   the lowest service ID is used.
 * - If there is a single consumer registered for the category, it is used
 * - If there is more than a single consumer registered for the category, the service
 *   with the highest service ranking is used. If the ranking is equal, the one with
 *   the lowest service ID is used.

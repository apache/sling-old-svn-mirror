# Queue Configuration and Job Event Handler
queue.name = Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration
queue.description = The configuration of a job processing queue.

queue.name.name = Name
queue.name.description = The name of the queue. If matching is used \
 the token \{0\} can be used to substitute the real value.

queue.type.name = Type
queue.type.description = The queue type.

queue.topics.name = Topics
queue.topics.description = This value is required and lists the topics processed by \
 this queue. The value is a list of strings. If a string ends with a dot, \
 all topics in exactly this package match. If the string ends with a star, \
 all topics in this package and all subpackages match. If the string neither \
 ends with a dot nor with a star, this is assumed to define an exact topic.

queue.priority.name = Priority
queue.priority.description = The priority for the threads from this queue. Default is norm.

queue.retries.name = Maximum Retries
queue.retries.description = The maximum number of times a failed job slated \
 for retries is actually retried. If a job has been retried this number of \
 times and still fails, it is not rescheduled and assumed to have failed. The \
 default value is 10.

queue.retrydelay.name = Retry Delay
queue.retrydelay.description = The number of milliseconds to sleep between two \
 consecutive retries of a job which failed and was set to be retried. The \
 default value is 2 seconds. This value is only relevant if there is a single \
 failed job in the queue. If there are multiple failed jobs, each job is \
 retried in turn without an intervening delay.

queue.maxparallel.name = Maximum Parallel Jobs
queue.maxparallel.description = The maximum number of parallel jobs started for this queue. \
 A value of -1 is substituted with the number of available processors.

queue.keepJobs.name = Keep Jobs
queue.keepJobs.description = If this option is enabled, successful finished jobs are kept \
 to provide a complete history.

queue.ranking.name = Ranking
queue.ranking.description = Integer value defining the ranking of this queue configuration. \
 If more than one queue matches a job topic, the one with the highest ranking is used.

queue.threadPoolSize.name = Thread Pool Size
queue.threadPoolSize.description = Optional configuration value for a thread pool to be used by \
 this queue. If this is value has a positive number of threads configuration, this queue uses \
 an own thread pool with the configured number of threads.

queue.preferRunOnCreationInstance.name = Prefer Creation Instance
queue.preferRunOnCreationInstance.description = If this option is enabled, the jobs are tried to \
 be run on the instance where the job was created.

#
# Job Event Handler
job.events.name = Apache Sling Job Default Queue 
job.events.description = The configuration of the default job queue.


#
# Event Pool
event.pool.name = Apache Sling Eventing Thread Pool 
event.pool.description = This is the thread pool used by the Apache Sling eventing support. The \
 threads from this pool are merely used for the job handling. By limiting this pool, it is \
 possible to limit the maximum number of parallel processed jobs - regardless of the queue \
 configuration.

minPoolSize.name = Pool Size
minPoolSize.description = The size of the thread pool. This pool is used to execute jobs and therefore \
 limits the maximum number of jobs executed in parallel.

#
# Consumer Manager
job.consumermanager.name = Apache Sling Job Consumer Manager
job.consumermanager.description = The consumer manager controls the job consumer (= processors). \
 It can be used to temporarily disable job processing on the current instance. Other instances \
 in a cluster are not affected.

job.consumermanager.whitelist.name = Topic Whitelist
job.consumermanager.whitelist.desscription = This is a list of topics which currently should be \
 processed by this instance. Leaving it empty, all job consumers are disabled. Putting a '*' as \
 one entry, enables all job consumers. Adding separate topics enables job consumers for exactly \
 this topic.

job.consumermanager.blacklist.name = Topic Blacklist
job.consumermanager.blacklist.desscription = This is a list of topics which currently shouldn't be \
 processed by this instance. Leaving it empty, all job consumers are enabled. Putting a '*' as \
 one entry, disables all job consumers. Adding separate topics disables job consumers for exactly \
 this topic.

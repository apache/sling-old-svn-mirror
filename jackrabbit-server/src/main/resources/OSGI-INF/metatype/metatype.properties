repository.name = Embedded JCR Repository
repository.description = Configuration to launch an embedded JCR Repository \
 and provide it as a SlingRepository, standard JCR Repository and CRXRepository. \
 In addition, if the registration URL is not empty, the repository is registered \
 as defined.

admin.name.name = Administator	
admin.name.description = The user name of the administrative user. This user \
 name is used to implement the SlingRepository.loginAdministrative(String) \
 method. It is intended for this user to provide full read/write access to \
 repository.
 
admin.password.name = Administrator Password	
admin.password.description = Password for the administrative user.

anonymous.name.name = Anonymous	
anonymous.name.description = The user name of the anonymous user. This user \
 name is used to implement the Repository.login methods without a Credentials \
 instance.
 
anonymous.password.name = Anonymous Password	
anonymous.password.description = Password for the anonymous user.

autostart.name = Autostart
autostart.description = Check to have the embedded JCR repository started as \
 soon as the configuration is activated. If not checked, the respository is \
 only started when used the first time.
 
config.name = Configuration File	
config.description = Filename or URL of the configuration file for the embedded \
 JCR repository. The name is first checked, whether it points to a readable file. \
 If no, the name is assumed to be an URL which must be accessible from the Sling \
 Server. \
 
defaultWorkspace.name = Default Workspace
defaultWorkspace.description = Name of the workspace to use by default if not \
 is given in any of the login methods. This name is used to implement the \
 SlingRepository.getDefaultWorkspace() method.
 
home.name = Repository Home	
home.description = Name of a filesystem directory in which to launch the \
 embedded JCR Repository.
 
pool.maxActive.name = Maximum Sessions	
pool.maxActive.description = The maximum number of sessions which may be logged \
 in through the Sling Repository. This number limits the number of sessions \
 provided by the session pool at any one time. If more sessions are requested \
 the respective threads have to wait for sessions to be logged out by other \
 threads. Default if negative or not set is virtually unlimited. \
 See Session Wait Time.
 
pool.maxActiveWait.name	= Session Wait Time
pool.maxActiveWait.description = The number of seconds to wait for a session \
 to become available if the maximum number of sessions has been provided. If \
 no session becomes available within time frame, access to the repository fails. \
 Default if negative or not set is 10 seconds.
 
pool.maxIdle.name = Maximum Idle Sessions
pool.maxIdle.description = The maximum number of sessions to keep in the pool. \
 The bigger this number, the more sessions are kept in the pool, the more login \
 round trips may be saved. On the other hand, each session requires a certain \
 amount of memory. Default if negative or not set is 10 idle sessions.
 
rmi.name = Embedded JCR Repository RMI Registrar
rmi.description = The RMI Registrar listens for CRX embedded repositories \
 to be registered as services and registers them in an RMI registry under the \
 name specified in the "name" service property.

rmi.port.name = Port Number
rmi.port.description = Port number of the RMI registry to use. The RMI Registrar \
 first tries to create a private RMI registry at this port. If this fails, an \
 existing registry is tried to connect at this port on local host. If this \
 number is negative, the RMI Registrar is disabled. If this number is higher \
 than 65535, an error message is logged and the RMI Registrar is also \
 disabled. If this number is zero, the system default RMI Registry port 1099 \
 is used.

jndi.name = Embedded JCR Repository JNDI Registrar
jndi.description = The JNDI Registrar listens for CRX embedded repositories \
 to be registered as services and registers them in the JNDI context under the \
 name specified in the "name" service property.

jndi.factory.name = Initial Context Factory
jndi.factory.description = The fully qualified class name of the factory class \
 that will create an initial context.
     
jndi.providerurl.name = Provider URL
jndi.providerurl.description =  An URL string for the service provider (e.g. \
 "ldap://somehost:389").
     
name.name = Embedded JCR Repository Name
name.description = The name under which the embedded repository will be \
 registered JNDI and RMI registries. The respective registry services listen \
 for embedded CRX repositories to be launched and register each under the name \
 configured. If no name is configured, the repository will not be registered.
